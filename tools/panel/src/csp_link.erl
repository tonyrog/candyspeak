%%% Drives one csp process as an Erlang port.
%%%
%%% The owner receives {csp_state, Cycle, [{Name,Value}]} for every state dump
%%% csp prints, and {csp_fired, Cycle, [{Object, File, Line}]} whenever the set
%%% of rules that fired changes (--fired; the code view lights them), and
%%% {csp_clock, Cycle, Ms} every cycle, Ms being the program's own clock since
%%% start. Note that csp dumps ON CHANGE, not every cycle, so a trace must
%%% hold its last value between dumps rather than expect one per tick.
%%%
%%% A NODE can be the other end instead: its console on tcp or a serial line
%%% (target/1). It has no -Q stream, so a tick asks: /dump state, read against
%%% the program /dump rom and /dump eeprom said it runs. The same messages come
%%% back, without csp_fired, and the node is never sent /quit -- closing just
%%% lets go of it. The owner also gets {csp_link, Text}, what is connected,
%%% and {csp_program, Text}: the node's program as source, listed off its image
%%% and patch by csp_list -- what it runs, whatever file the panel had open.
%%%
%%% Ticking is ours to drive: /commit runs exactly one cycle and prints nothing
%%% but the dump. /state would also step, but adds a page of human text to parse
%%% past, and an empty line steps nothing at all.
